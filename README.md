<!-- ## 1. Project description ðŸ‘‡

### **_Development of KPI Dashboards and Reporting System, using Power Query, Power Pivot (DAX), and NLP tools._**

For this project, I used a "Spotify App Reviews" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaaris/spotify-app-reviews-2022). After being processed, the output was explored and saved in Tableau Public. -->

## BI Flow and Components

### I. Power Query for ETL

### II: Power Pivot (DAX) for Data Modeling
Relationships, indicators, optimization.

DAX is a formula language that allows users to create custom calculations & expressions in Power BI.

It is similar to Excel formulas but is specifically designed for use in Power BI & other Microsoft BI tools.


1. **Sales Metrics:** Compute total revenue, average order value, and sales growth. **DAX Functions:** SUM, AVERAGE, CALCULATE, YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH
 
2. **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Segment customers based on purchase patterns. **DAX Functions:** COUNTROWS, FILTER, RELATED, RANKX, SWITCH
 
3. **Time Intelligence:** Analyze YTD sales, MoM growth, and YoY performance. **DAX Functions:** TOTALYTD, TOTALMTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATESYTD, DATEADD

- CALENDARAUTO() => DAX function for Time Intelligence

4. **Financial Reporting:** Calculate margins, ROI, and other financial metrics. **DAX Functions:** DIVIDE, CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, RELATEDTABLE

5. **Product Performance:** Evaluate sales by category and profitability. **DAX Functions:** CALCULATE, FILTER, RELATEDTABLE, TOPN, RANKX

### III: Reporting
Data visualization, reports, dashboards, storytelling.
