# Sales and Business Report with Microsoft Power BI ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼ðŸ“ˆ 

![Let's Get the Party Started](https://media.giphy.com/media/i79P9wUfnmPyo/giphy.gif)

This repository contains the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for analyzing data from the "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.xlsx" file using Power BI. The Excel file has been pre-processed to include a "COGS" (Cost of Goods Sold) column and updated branch names from the series "The Office".

Before continuing into this repository, I was already working in Power BI until reaching the point where it can be seen in the following image:

- The first thing I wanted to know was if sales were correlated with the company's profits. In the scatterplot we can see that this is not the case. 

- We could think that the more we sell, the more profits we will have; However, we notice that there are losses in this graph.

As data professionals, we should not assume anything and take our conclusions for granted. Next, I will show you the components of my project:

## 1. Project description ðŸ‘‡
### _Business Analytics: EDA with Python, ETL & Power BI._

- This project explores the components of Business Intelligence (BI) flow and practical uses of some DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Microsoft Power BI.

- The project aims to demonstrate how Python and Power BI merge together in a BI workflow, in handling data outliers...

- The focus is on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to do the data cleaning of outliers in the Fact table... 

- Following the EDA, the project employs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare the data for advanced analysis and interactive visualizations in Power BI. 

- DAX is perfomed to create business metrics and KPIs, enabling data-driven decision-making...



### Functional architecture design:

![DM_pipeline](https://github.com/AndrewBavuels/Sales-and-Business-Report-with-Microsoft-Power-BI/blob/main/architecture/Dunder%20Mifflin%20data%20pipeline.png)

### I. Power Query for ETL
Data extraction, source consolidation, cleaning, and transformation.

### Extract
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Select "Get Data" and choose "Excel".
3. Locate and select "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.xlsx".
4. Choose the table format sheets (for this case, "Sales", "SKU" and "State_Branches").

#### Coming up next, we will see the dimension table "State_Branches" has no relation to the fact one "Sales"

#### So, we need to do some transforming work in Power Query:

### Transform
1. Rename columns for State_Branches by **using first rows as headers:**

2. Check the **Model View** if the relation to Sales was created:

3. Check in the **Table View** the fact table "Sales" and determine the measures we will create from:

### Load
1. Apply changes and close Power Query Editor.
2. Load transformed data into the Power BI data model.
3. Establish relationships between tables if multiple tables are used.
4. Create visualizations:
   - Bar charts showing sales by branch.
   - Line charts for monthly sales trends.
   - Tables displaying profit margins.

### Summary
The ETL process does not run continuously but at key moments when needed:

- Integrate new data sources.
- Update existing data.
- Develop new analyses or reports.
- Modify the data structure.
- Perform data maintenance or cleaning.

The frequency and exact timing of the ETL execution will depend on the specific needs of your data analysis and the nature of your data sources.


### II: Power Pivot (DAX) for Data Modeling
Relationships, indicators, optimization.

DAX is a formula language that allows users to create custom calculations & expressions in Power BI.

It is similar to Excel formulas but is specifically designed for use in Power BI & other Microsoft BI tools.


1. **Sales Metrics:** Compute total revenue, average order value, and sales growth. **DAX Functions:** SUM, AVERAGE, CALCULATE, YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH
 
2. **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Segment customers based on purchase patterns. **DAX Functions:** COUNTROWS, FILTER, RELATED, RANKX, SWITCH
 
3. **Time Intelligence:** Analyze YTD sales, MoM growth, and YoY performance. **DAX Functions:** TOTALYTD, TOTALMTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATESYTD, DATEADD

- CALENDARAUTO() => DAX function for Time Intelligence

4. **Financial Reporting:** Calculate margins, ROI, and other financial metrics. **DAX Functions:** DIVIDE, CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, RELATEDTABLE

5. **Product Performance:** Evaluate sales by category and profitability. **DAX Functions:** CALCULATE, FILTER, RELATEDTABLE, TOPN, RANKX

### III: Reporting
Data visualization, reports, dashboards, storytelling.
<!-- **Example Preview** -->

## **2. Technology stack ðŸ’»**

### Data Visualization Tools:
- [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/): For interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.

### Extensions and Other Tools:

- [DAX Formatter](https://www.daxformatter.com/): For formatting Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries.








## DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
This project also includes practical uses of DAX in Power BI to create calculated columns and measures for enhanced data analysis.

## Visualizations
- **Sales by Branch**: Bar chart showing sales for each branch.
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: Line chart depicting sales trends over time.
- **Profit Margins**: Table with calculated profit margins.

## How to Use
1. Download the repository and open the Power BI file.
2. Ensure the "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.xlsx" file is in the correct location.
3. Refresh the data in Power BI to see updated analyses and visualizations.

## Requirements
- Power BI Desktop
- Excel file: "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.xlsx"

### Is DAX part of the ETL process?

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is not inherently part of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. However, DAX is commonly used in conjunction with ETL in tools like Microsoft Power BI to perform data analysis once the data has been extracted, transformed, and loaded into the data model.

### Role of DAX in the ETL Process:

1. **Post-data load**: Once the data has been transformed and loaded into the data model, DAX expressions are used to perform calculations and analysis on this data. This includes creating measures, calculated columns, and calculated tables that provide insights and metrics relevant for data analysis.

2. **Calculation of derived data**: DAX is used to calculate derived values or specific metrics needed for reports and analysis. For example, calculating profit margins, growth rates, weighted averages, etc.

3. **Creating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: DAX allows defining KPIs that help monitor the performance of a business or process. These KPIs can be based on calculated measures using DAX expressions to calculate key values.

4. **Data filtering and segmentation**: DAX is used to filter and segment data based on specific criteria, allowing for more detailed and focused data analysis.

5. **Integration with ETL**: While DAX is not part of the ETL process itself, transformations performed during the ETL process can influence the calculations and analysis done with DAX. For example, calculated columns created during transformation can be subsequently used in DAX expressions.

In summary, while ETL prepares the data for analysis, DAX is used to perform advanced analysis and calculations on this data once it has been loaded into the data model. Together, ETL and DAX are part of an integrated data analysis process in tools like Power BI.
